## Static html/css/js frontend

If you want to test this locally run `python frontend/build.py .` and point
your browser to `frontend/htdocs/` directory. The only argument to `build.py`
is the root directory of the project.

If you want to deploy to GitHub pages, run `./deploy_html.sh` and follow the
link that script outputs.
